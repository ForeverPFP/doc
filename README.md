## What is ForeverPFP?
ForeverPFP is an onchain contract to help connecting web3 people by onchain data with two main functions:
- Bind your forever PFP to an address like [Primary ENS Name](https://app.ens.domains/faq#what-is-a-primary-ens-name-record).
- A PFP verification list maintained by the community to avoid PFP image copycats.

## Why ForeverPFP?
- By binding your forever PFP to your address, if you set twitter account in your primary ENS for the same address, we can make you find your PFP community members twitter accounts by onchain data.
- We can [set avatar in ENS](https://medium.com/@brantly.eth/step-by-step-guide-to-setting-an-nft-as-your-ens-profile-avatar-3562d39567fc), but without ownership verification, you can set other people's PFP image, ForeverPFP verify the ownership to make data right.
- PFP holder can have more than one PFPs in one address, but for the social networking better knowing your "face", it would be better choose a forever PFP by binding it.
- We have getName(address) function provided by ENS now, we will have getPFP(address) function by ForeverPFP, with this you can easy to get your Ethereum ID(ENS name and PFP image) anywhere with one ethereum address signed to login.
- Verify PFP collections to avoid same image copycats confusing people.
